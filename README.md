# steep-seeker

Steep Seeker is a website that presents a standardized rating system to allow skiers to compare trails or resorts. Ever wonder how your local resort's definition of a black diamond stacks up to others? The goal of this rating system is to provide hard truths to questions like these. Resorts rate their trails relative only to the other trails at the resort, and as such there is tremendous variance between mountains, and especially between regions.

Steep Seeker is an evolution of [https://github.com/joshua-coppola/Ski-Trail-Ratings] and can be seen as a V2.
