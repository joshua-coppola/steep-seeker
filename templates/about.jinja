      <p>The goal of this project is to allow for skiers and riders to have a
      reliable metric with which to compare trails between mountains. Often,
      a black diamond trail at one ski area is very different from another
      black diamond trail at a different ski area, especially across
      geographic regions. Our standardized rating scale aims to fix this.</p>

      <h2>How It Works</h2>

      <p>The data for each map comes from OpenStreetMaps and USGS.
      OpenStreetmaps is used for the routes of each trail at a mountain.
      This data is provided by the community, and is not error free. Should a
      problem with a mountain be identified, the best course of action is to
      correct the problem on OSM, then reach out so we can update the map. The
      OSM data is then supplemented with elevation data from USGSâ€™s NED10
      elevation dataset. This dataset provides high quality elevation data
      with a 10 meter resolution for the entire United States (minus some
      parts of Alaska). Unfortunately, elevation data of sufficient quality
      (10m or better resolution) is rare for other countries, hence why only
      US mountains are included.</p>
      
      <p>On each map, the degree label on each trail is for the steepest 60
      meters. The colors are determined by the same 60 meters, plus a
      modifier of 7 degrees if the trail is gladed.</p>

      <h2 id="about-rankings">Mountain Rankings</h2>
      <p>There are two types of mountain comparison barplots: how hard the
      hardest trails are and how easy the easiest area is. This is created
      using a weighted average of the top 20 hardest and easiest trails to
      create a metric that describes how expert and beginner friendly an
      area is, and how it stacks up to other mountains. </p>
